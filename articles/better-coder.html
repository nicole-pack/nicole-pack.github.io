			<article class="blog_post">
				I decided I needed to create my own website when I was applying for jobs 
				and had felt I had nothing to show for my efforts.  I had contributed to 
				a moderately impressive project my senior year in college, but not much 
				of it that I could call my own.  I had been taking free coding classes 
				online, but didn't find the results very compelling.  I felt a drive to 
				code and learn and create new things!  But alas, I found myself in the 
				pitfall between beginner and developer.<br>
				So, if I was going to have a (in my opinion) mediocre resume, I could most
				definitely build a website to display my resume in a little bit more exciting
				way.  It could also be a platform to display my finished projects (when I finish them) 
				and blog about my progress.<br>
				To begin, I went through the Codecademy HTML and CSS courses and formed a 
				rudimentary "website."  This initial site, however, didn't even have a CSS 
				page linked to it.  I had become so discouraged at the "simplicity" of the 
				introductory course, that I set the script aside for five months before 
				remembering how excited I had been to do it in the first place and how worth
				while it is to have the opportunity and ability to brand myself.<br>
				So I jumped into it, purposefully hodge-podging my way through a wire-frame 
				set up.  After three days, I ended up with a jumble of text elements, placeholders,
				and piles of nested <div>'s with barebones CSS on a page that honestly didn't 
				look much different from the five-month-old original.  While it was fun to observe 
				the little progress I had made in those three days, I realized I could no longer 
				shun the world of tutorials.<br>
				The Mozilla Developer Network web docs was the site I chose because I felt I could 
				take it as an authority.  The MDN does a good job of explaining the essentials in 
				detail for the HTML tutorial.  I found it easy to skim the things I remembered from
				the Codecademy introduction.  I was thankful for their insight on what is common 
				practice for web development as well as considering all users in the explaination 
				of certain tools.  Throughout, they speak of the possible downfalls that lazy writing 
				can cause for the visually impaired.  While this should be expected (to know your user
				and teach to cater to them), I was thankful for the humbling experience I got when I
				realized how terrible my methodology in coding had been this whole time.<br>
				From the moment I began coding, I was thrilled to acheive the expected result.  When 
				coming up with my own ideas and solutions to problems, the scope of the result was based 
				on what I wanted or needed to happen.  Certainly, I did think up ways these ideas would 
				be helpful to others, but they revolved around the way I experienced my code.  The casual 
				yet important discussion of writing code that is usable and useful to more than just the 
				majority of people helped me increase in my passion for coding and the work and maintainance 
				it requires!  It's not about just finding the right answer, but about creating solutions for 
				everyone who comes into contact with your code.<br>
				So for now, I'm still not the greatest web developer.  Not by a long shot.  But I am a better
				coder and developer in a most unexpected way.  I thought I understood why I love coding so much,
				but the vast world of computer science has me burning to learn and understand more.  
				Forever a student, I guess.  However, it's not such a bad place to be.

			<article class="blog_post">
				If you've been on Youtube for a while, you may know about a phenomenon known as VEDA, 
				which stands for Vlog Every Day in April.  I'm unaware of the origin of this or if youtubers 
				even still participate in this, but it is a way of forcing the creative juices to flow.  
				It is a time for the good, the bad, and the ugly to get flushed out.  In the time since 
				the initial commit of my website, jobs were applied to, rejection was recieved, and long 
				waiting games have begun.  These events have given me the push I needed to put my more 
				elaborate plans into action.<br>
				In my hopes to emulate the VEDA process, I will be posting to Github every day for the month 
				of April.  Greatness will always be strived for, whether or not it is achieved.  My goals, 
				other than coding something every day, are to update my website, not only asthetics but adding 
				functionality, specifically the blog portion.  I am also striving to complete five different 
				Java projects, no matter how small, before learning a new language.  Also, I want to learn more 
				about Github: how it works, what people use it for, becoming comfortable with the community.<br>
				So, why am I doing this?  It may be obvious already, but here is my personal account of how 
				I hope to better my skills this month.  Why post to Github every day?  It's about "commit"ment 
				(haha, git it? (okay, I'll stop now)).  Sometimes you have to admit you don't know something or 
				there are some things you just don't want to buckle down and do.  On days such as there, we do
				it any way.  All the while, saying "I know this sucks.  I know I suck at this."  Because not 
				only is humility important, it is at the heart of growth.  It's also nice to look back at those
				dark days and see the shining progress that followed.<br>
				Why am I working so hard to build a website when I'm a Java programmer? To be awesome! And form 
				a brand for myself.  The concept of branding oneself is new to me, but makes total sense.  The 
				reason I built this website, instead of using a service to build it for me, is because I like 
				being in control of my outlets of expression.  I feel most comfortable when I understand how 
				these things work.  Also, I want to be versitile!  I've clung to Java for a while, since it is 
				the language I first learned to program, but I will not be the last to admit that Java is not the 
				end all be all.  I don't know yet what my career path will be, and web design seemed like an obvious 
				option as well as a simple first step out of my comfort zone.<br>
				If Java isn't my One True Programmoing language, why am I building FIVE java programs before moving 
				on?  Although versitility is important as a programmer, quality is always better than quantity.  
				I want to solidify my Java skills because it is the number one language I advertaise when telling 
				people I am a programmer.  In reality, it has been almost two years since I have done any serious 
				Java programming.  Also, I'm having a lot of fun finally coming up with my own ideas to implement. 
				I feel like a lot of beginners struggle with this step in programming and, for me, exploring and 
				understanding the Java libraries have helped me come up with ideas.<br>
				Have I bitten off more than I can chew, or is this just the tip of the iceberg?  I feel the goals 
				I have set are simple enough just as long as I keep coding every day, which is really the heart of 
				this challenge.  My approach for this month, in order to make this a learning process and not just
				a todo list, is to do as much as possible without references like StackOverflow, Youtube tutorials, 
				or any sort of step-by-step here-is-how-you-make-this material.  I have already put this into practice
				by going to the APIs of the programming language to find the correct tools.  I've come to find out 
				that the closer I get to the root of whatever technology I'm using, the easier it is for me to 
				conceptualize and understand the bigger picture.<br>
				However, a lot of the Java and Mozilla Developer reference websites spell out exactly how to code
				a solution.  In these situations, I take care to understand it before implementing instead of straight
				up copying their solution.  Many things can only be learned through example, and I usually do end up 
				looking at the spoon-fed solutions after I've implemented my best guess, just to see how others go about 
				solving a problem.  As a result, I hope to learn more about myself and my methods of problem solving. 
				In the end, this month is all about being certain of my progress, understanding, and ability to learn and
				stay focussed.<br>

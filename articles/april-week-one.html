			<h1 class="blog_title">Week One Update: Git out and Code!</h1>
			<article class="blog_post">
			The week started off strong, but household responsibilities and sick family members make the latter half of the week difficult.  
			At least once, I had to submit just four lines of comments, no actual code.  I wasn't happy about it, but it's water under the 
			bridge.  Saturday and Sunday I didn't actually submit to GitHub, but changes had been made dispite this.  Today will be getting 
			the repository caught up to changes made over the weekend.  I feel great about this new week.  Although a little worried about 
			my progress on projects, I feel strong and hopeful about what I can accomplish this week.<br>
			One point of improvement: I tend to get overwhelmed by the many things I want/need to learn next.  I think because I have so 
			many project ideas now and, in general, there are a lot of semi-basic concepts I don't feel 100% comfortable with. While this 
			feeling has continued this past week, I have managed to quell the urge to jump between tasks without purpose.  I remind myself 
			what is most important right now and that while it would be nice to jump into all of my many projects, it is more important at 
			this point to finish a project.<br>
			As for an update on the technical side of my first week of coding everyday, the Tic Tac Toe game was looking a bit grim, but I 
			have just realized it has come a bit farther than I had realized.  It's really coming together with the different player types.  
			Now for me to discover a glaring issue with the design and have to start basically from scratch.  Let's hope there are many 
			lessons to be learned.<br>

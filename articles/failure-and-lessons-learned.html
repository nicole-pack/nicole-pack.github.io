			The second week of coding every day went much the same as the first.  There were times i felt I could code for hours and other 
			days when it was difficult to get my thoughts straight.  When I ended up taking the weekend off again, I figured it probably 
			wasn't a bad habit to be getting into.  This was a result I was expecting, although not quite so soon.  I was expecting to hit 
			a wall and become burnt out at some point, although I wasn't prepared for it.  My goal was to work through the drudgery I felt; 
			to feel burnt out, and then move on.<br>
			Despite this being an already difficult display of willpower, I ran into another problem.  I found myself unable to power my 
			will.  There was something missing in all of this.  At the root of my attempt to code everyday for a month, creating a website 
			for myself, getting back into coding in general, was the need for me to get a job.  Not just a want, but a need for my family 
			to thrive.  The thing that got me most excited about continuing my journey as a programmer was imagining the life I could have 
			once my career was grown and healthy.  However, these imaginations are far off, and I knew this.  And when I looked around me, 
			things looked a little more grim than they had before I started my jaunt back into coding.  Why was I doing this to myself?  
			Why was I doing this to my family?<br>
			So, I decided I would take a week off.  I needed to refocus on household needs and hoped that, in the process, I would find 
			what motivates me to be a programmer, if that motivation actually exsists.  That week has come and gone, and I haven't yet 
			started up my coding every day.  But what I have come to realize is that, bottom line, what I am working toward is a future 
			where I can provide for my family a suitable living space, enough food to eat, and the ability to be happy.  These wants are 
			simple, but I don't yet know what it takes to get there.<br>
			So, a different approach is needed.  I have heard of some self taught programmers who take an approach that is a little broader 
			than coding every day.  Instead they set an hourly goal for a month.  This allows days off when needed that can be balanced with 
			days when I can get a lot done.  I am excited about the prospects of actually finishing a project, and I hope I am able to get 
			back into it soon.<br>
